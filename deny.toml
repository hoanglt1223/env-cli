# This template contains all of the possible sections and their default values

# Note that all fields that take a lint level have these possible values:
# * deny - An error will be produced and the check will fail
# * warn - A warning will be produced, but the check will not fail
# * allow - No warning or error will be produced, though in some cases a note
# *   will be

# If 1 or more target triples (and optionally, target_features) are specified,
# only the specified targets will be checked when running `cargo deny check`.
# This means, if a particular package is only ever used as a target specific
# dependency, it will not be checked for linting, since it will never be
# compiled for the targets that are being inspected.
# This can be useful when checking dependencies for platforms that are not the host
# platform of the CI runner (eg. checking WASM deps on a Linux runner).

# If you want to keep target-specific dependencies in your graph, but still
# want to find and ban duplicate or illegal versions of dependencies that are
# _only_ used in target-specific dependencies, you can set this to true.
# This field was true by default, but now that `target = []` is also the default
# there is no reason to set this to true anymore.
