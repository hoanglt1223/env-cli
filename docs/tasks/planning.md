# Project Planning

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive planning and execution strategy for the env-cli project, categorized into EC (Executive Core) tasks that provide progressive implementation of environment variable management functionality.

## Task Categories

### EC Tasks (Executive Core)
Core business functionality and foundational system components.

- **EC-01**: ✅ Init source code with latest stable rust (COMPLETED)
- **EC-02**: Core Environment Management Implementation
- **EC-03**: Advanced Scanning and Synchronization Features

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (EC-01) ✅ COMPLETED
- Initialize project structure
- Set up Rust development environment
- Establish basic project scaffolding
- Create CLI framework with clap
- Set up CI/CD infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Environment Management (EC-02)
- Implement project initialization and configuration system
- Build environment switching and validation features
- Create secure backup and restore mechanisms
- Develop TOML-based configuration management
- Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (EC-03)
- Implement multi-language code scanning engine
- Build environment synchronization system
- Create automated generation and documentation features
- Develop plugin architecture and performance optimizations
- Add enterprise-grade security and audit capabilities

### Future Phases (Post-EC-03)
- **Integration Ecosystem**: IDE plugins, shell completion, developer tool integration
- **Enterprise Features**: Team collaboration, advanced security, compliance reporting
- **Cloud Integration**: Cloud provider synchronization, distributed environments
- **AI/ML Features**: Intelligent environment suggestions, anomaly detection

## Task Status Tracking

Each task has its own markdown file in this directory with:
- Detailed task description and requirements
- Comprehensive implementation details and phases
- Real-time progress tracking with completion status
- Clear completion criteria and success metrics
- Technical specifications and architecture
- Security considerations and performance targets

## Dependencies

Tasks have clear dependency chains:
- **EC-01** → **EC-02** → **EC-03** → **Future Features**

Each task builds upon the foundation of previous tasks, creating a progressive development approach that ensures quality and maintainability.

## Current Status

### Completed ✅
- **EC-01**: Complete Rust project initialization with professional CI/CD infrastructure

### In Progress 🚧
- **EC-02**: Ready for implementation with comprehensive specification

### Planned 📋
- **EC-03**: Detailed planning complete, dependent on EC-02 completion

## Project Vision

env-cli aims to become the industry-standard tool for environment variable management, providing:
- **Developer Productivity**: Streamlined workflows and intelligent automation
- **Enterprise Security**: Secure handling of sensitive configuration data
- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-developer environment management
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing development tools
- **Scalability**: Performance suitable for large enterprise codebases
